  summary: Glider survey to detect salmon mortality tags. Slocum gliders are
    small, free-swimming, unmanned vehicles that use changes in buoyancy to move
    vertically and horizontally through the water column in a saw-tooth pattern.
    They are deployed for days to several months and gather detailed information
    about the physical, chemical and biological processes of the world's oceans.
    The Slocum glider was designed and built by Teledyne Webb Research
    Corporation, Falmouth, MA, USA.
