summary             = "The Labrador Sea is an area of intense focus for scientific studies looking at water mass transformation and the oceanic carbon sink. However, winter-time measurements, particularly at the mesoscale are lacking. Through funding from the Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI) we are undertaking a multiyear program with gliders to measure oxygen and heat exchange in the Labrador Sea called HOTSeALS (Heat & Oxygen Transport Sensing Across the Labrador Sea). The project is a collaboration with the National Oceanography Centre Project TERIFIC (Targeted Experiment to Reconcile Increased Freshwater with Increased Convection) led by Dr. Eleanor Frajka-Williams." ;
